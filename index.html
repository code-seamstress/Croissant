    <h1>The Croissant</h1>
    <p class="croissant-history">
      Rumour has it that Marie Antoinette, who was born in Vienna, introduced
      the croissant to Paris in 1770 before the French Revolution, but
      croissants only appeared in a widespread way in France in the mid-19th
      century, the first description of a Viennese baker in Paris being in 1838.
